# CoterieCraft
I don't know how it really works here yet, but I think I just have to update things on here if I edit a texture or add one :)
You can submit any texture issues to the issue place thingy. 
If you have made any textures send me a PM on the minecraft forum or idk you can leave it as an issue I guess, because it might be an issue that your textures are not in CoterieCraft... I guess... 
Atleast upload those images to imgur then
